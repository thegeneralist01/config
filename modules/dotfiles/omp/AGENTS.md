# Global agent defaults

- Prefer `jj` for version-control operations in repos that are JJ-backed.
- Avoid mutating `git` commands unless explicitly asked for git or the repo is plain Git.
- Keep edits focused and minimal; explain intent briefly before major changes.
- Run relevant checks/tests after code changes when practical.
- If scope is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before editing.

## Filesystem hygiene

- Avoid broad recursive scans of `$HOME` or `/`.
- Do not traverse `node_modules/`, `.git/`, build outputs, or other large generated directories unless specifically needed.
- When looking for config files, check known paths directly instead of scanning unrelated directories.

## Academic / preprint style

When drafting or editing scientific papers and preprints:

- Use precise scientific tone; avoid colloquialisms, idioms, and storytelling language.
- Replace defensive hedging with direct claims bounded by the evidence.
- Remove empty boilerplate, placeholders, `TODO`/`FIXME`, and draft apologies before final compilation.
- Prefer exact structural verbs and adjectives over generic wording.
